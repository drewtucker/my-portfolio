# My Portfolio

#### This is a portfolio page designed to show off some of the projects that i've made in the last week, and tell a little about myself.

#### By Drew Tucker

## Description

This website was designed to demonstrate my understand of the curriculum for this week, including the use of HTML, CSS, GitHub and Bootstrap. It has links to 4 of the projects I worked on this week, as well as descriptions for what they do, and the languages I used to make them. I also included an About Me section that tells a little bit about where I come from and what I like to do.
