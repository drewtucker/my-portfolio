        <h5><a href="https://github.com/dtuck43/resort-website.git">The Last Resort</a></h5>
        <p>This is a basic webpage that was made to practice the concepts of creating branches using Git. In it, myself and my partner were tasked with creating two seperate layouts for a resort's website, and then merging the preferred branch of the two into the master branch. What we ended up making was more of a 'worst vacation you could imagine' page, hence the name "The Last Resort".</p>

        <h5><a href="https://github.com/dtuck43/cupcake-shop.git">Cupcake Shop</a></h5>
        <p>This is a website designed to show off 'Drew's Tasty Cakes', an imaginary Cupcake company. It was made to practice using specific tags to style certain elements on the page. I created a seperate page that contains a menu and pricing for several different cupcakes, and highlights which of the cakes is the best seller.</p>

        <p>Ever dream of white sand, gentle waves, and palm trees? Then look no further than this page, designed to highlight the Maldives. It gives a little history, and provides several travel packages to choose from, including pricing and accomodations. This was made to practice formatting a page using Bootstrap, using tools such as panels, containers, jumbotrons and blockquotes.</p>

        <p>This page is a summary of all that I learned during my first week at Epicodus. In it I practiced using Bootsrap to format the page, and familiarized myself with the grid system, including using rows and columns, and using color to highlight specific lines of text.</p>

        <p>I was born March 20, 1992 in Redmond, Washington, where I lived until just a few months ago. Growing up, I would watch my dad and my older brother build their own computers, and it sparked in me a love and fascination for technology that I still carry with me today. I'm constantly looking for ways to improve myself both as a developer and an individual, and I can't wait to continue my career as an aspiring programmer. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
